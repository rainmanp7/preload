Here are the steps to follow to create a new cairo release:

1) Ensure that there are no local, uncommitted modifications. The best
   thing to do here may be to begin with a fresh checkout from CVS,
   but it's probably good enough if "cvs -q update -Ad" generates no
   output.

2) Verify that the code passes "make distcheck"

	Running "make distcheck" should result in no warnings or errors.

3) Fill out an entry in the NEWS file

	Sift through the information in ChangeLog since the last
	release. Summarize major changes briefly in a style similar
	to other entries in NEWS.

4) Increment the version number in configure.ac:

	See the VERSION section of README file for instructions on
	how the version number should change.

5) Commit the changes to NEWS and configure.in

	It's specially important to mention the new version number in the
	commit message.

6) Run "make release-publish" which will perform the following steps
   for you:

	* Verify that make distcheck completes successfully
	* Generate the final tar file
	* Generate an sha1sum file
	* Sign the sha1sum using your GPG setup (asks for your GPG password)
	* Provide some text for the release announcement (see below).

7) If everything is Ok at this point, tag the entire source tree with a tag
   of the form PRELOAD_X_Y(_Z) by using:

	cvs tag PRELOAD_X_Y(_Z)

8) Increment the micro version component to the next larger (odd) number in
   configure, and commit.

9) Follow the instruction provided from "make release-publish" to upload
   the files and make announcements.
